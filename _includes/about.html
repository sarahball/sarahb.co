		<p>I'm Sarah Ball, a location-independent designer and developer who loves turning ideas into pixels. Practical but pretty design makes me happy, as does working to support good people and the planet. When I'm not at my computer I live to be outdoors â€“ I'm an avid hiker and <a href="http://unsplash.com/@satelliteeyes" target="_blank">travel photographer</a>.</p>
