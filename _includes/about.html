		<p>I'm Sarah Ball, a location-independent designer and developer who loves turning ideas into pixels. I'm <a href="#worktogether">seeking work</a> in San Francisco, London, or remote. Practical but pretty design makes me happy, as does working to support good people and the planet. When I'm not at my computer I live to be outdoors â€“ I'm an avid hiker and travel photographer.</p>
