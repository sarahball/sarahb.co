	<div class="item-content b">
		I'm a designer who codes, and this deeply affects my work and process. I can efficiently prototype, communicate clearly with developers, and gain an understanding of the possibilities and constraints of a design based on the languages we use.

		<b>Making user-centric interfaces</b>
	</div>
	<div class="item-content c">
		I think foremost in terms of usability. I donâ€™t feel comfortable making design decisions that are purely aesthetic. To keep this front-of-mind, I always ask: What is the objective of this screen/section? What are users looking for, and how are they using the screen based on their different goals? How does my visual design reflect their intentions and needs?

		<b>Tackling challenges collaboratively</b>
	</div>
	<div class="item-content d">
		My experience has taught me to communicate how my designs serve big picture goals. Being a coder means I can give developers a smooth hand-off. And on design teams, I love pair designing to work through goals and challenges. No ego, just a "yes, and" mentality in giving and receiving feedback and turning it into a solution.
