### About

This is the repository for [sarahb.co](https://sarahb.co). It's my landing page, portfolio, and all-around homebase on the internet.

I'm Sarah Ball, a UI designer and developer (front-end and Wordpress). You can reach me by [email](mailto:hi@sarahb.co) or [@_satelliteeyes](http://www.twitter.com/_satelliteeyes).

### Contributing

This is a personal site, not a collaborative project. That being said, there's always room for improvement in my code and workflow. If you'd like to submit a pull request, best to send me an email or tweet first.

### License

You're welcome to inspect and duplicate any code you like from this site. Images and words are my copyright unless otherwise noted. If you're thinking of forking this, I wouldn't recommend it. Start with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) instead.
